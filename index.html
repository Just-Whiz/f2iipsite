          <h1>Home</h1>
          <p> Welcome to my website! </p>
          <p> This is a site that I created with guidance from Professor Hao Loi and his graduate teachinga assistant Robbie Oleynick. 
            I was lucky enough to attend the CS Major during 2023, and this website along with its contents were created during that time. 
            There's many different projects linked here as well, in my <a href="page2.html">Portfolio</a> page. 
          </p>
          <p>If you want to learn a little bit about me, and what I'm up to nowadays, check out the <a href="page1.html">About Me</a> section of this website.
          It should contain information that you may or may not want to know about me, interests, hobbies, etc. all on one convenient web page.</p>
          <p>Finally, if you for some reason want to make contact with me, my (online) contact information is linked on my <a href="page3">Contact Me</a> page.
          I should have all the links to areas online that I frequent often, and maybe a blog or YouTube channel if I'm feeling adventurous. Be warned though:
          DM me at will.</p>
          <p> Okay, that's it. I've run out of meaningful things to say for this
            placeholder content, and can't be bothered to think up any more
            stuff that you're just going to skip reading over anyway.</p>
          <p>Have fun exploring my website :-)</p>
